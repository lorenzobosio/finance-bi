## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Stack]: Tremor Raw (copy-paste, Tailwind v4 + Recharts) instead of the frozen `@tremor/react` npm package — research-confirmed deviation; resolve in Phase 0
- [Phase 1]: First task is a discovery spike enumerating which Revolut accounts/pockets Enable Banking exposes + the real consent-window duration; gates Phase 3 and Phase 6 design
- [Correctness]: `flow_type=investimento`/`transferência` excluded from all cost/revenue aggregations; €4k fed to goal exactly once — a Phase 1/2 contract, not retrofittable

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Enable Banking live behavior is unverified: which Revolut accounts/pockets appear, exact `expires_at` format/range, pending→booked lifecycle, 429 limits. Must be confirmed in the Phase 1 discovery spike before finalizing the Phase 1 plan.
- Investment pocket likely NOT exposed via PSD2 — build the €100k goal on the outgoing €4k contribution leg (cost basis), not an investment balance.
